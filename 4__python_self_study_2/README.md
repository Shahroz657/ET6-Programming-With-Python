# Python Self-Study 2

All of the workshop resources in this series will only use language features covered in [Python Self-Study 1](../2__python_self_study_1/).  But as you become more comfortable programming you may want to explore further and practice solving harder challenges.

To prepare for the next steps in your Python journey, you should study these
language features using your favorite resources in the language of your choice.
You don't need to master them, just be familiar. Donâ€™t forget to study using Documentation, Tests and Predictive Stepping!

- [x] **Collections**: dictionaries, tuples, sets
- [x] **Iteration**: `iter()`, `next()`, `enumerate()`
- [x] **F-Strings**: `f"... {expression} ..."`
- [x] **Data Types**: `None`
- [x] **Operators**: ones that weren't in Self-Study 1
- [x] **Parameters**: default values, `*args`, `**kwargs`, keyword-only
      parameters, positional-only parameters
- [x] **Arguments**: positional, keyword
- [x] **Control Flow**: `_ if _ else _`, `_ for _ in _`, `break`, `continue`
- [x] **Scope Modifiers**: `nonlocal var_name`, `global var_name`
- [x] **Modules**

This list is also just a suggestion based on what you might need to solve
challenges on platforms like CodeWars of LeetCode. Follow your interests! Study
your favorite tutorials and work on challenges you find fun, then focus on the
language features you need.

> _PS. You **do not** need to study Classes for ET Foundations!_
